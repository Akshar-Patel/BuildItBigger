# Build It Bigger: Android App for Joke-Telling
### Used Gradle to build a joke-telling app that has both a free and paid version. This included factoring functionality into libraries as well as using build flavors to modularize the construction of each variant of the app. I also configured a Google Cloud Endpoints development server to supply the jokes.
